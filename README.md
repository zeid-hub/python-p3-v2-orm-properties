# ORM Validation and Properties : Code-Along

## Learning Goals

- Evolve attributes to properties.
- Adapt ORM methods to validate object state with properties

---

## Key Vocab

- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: a programming technique that provides a
  mapping between an object-oriented data model and a relational database model.
- **Attribute**: variables that belong to an object.
- **Property**: attributes that are controlled by methods.
- **Decorator**: function that takes another function as an argument and returns
  a new function with added functionality.

---

## Introduction

Let's update our company data model to add some constraints on the `Department`
and `Employee` attributes:

- The `Department` name and location must be non-empty strings.
- The `Employee` name and and job title must be non-empty strings.
- The `Employee` department_id must be a foreign key reference to a `Department`
  object that has been persisted to the database.

We'll evolve the attributes to be managed by property methods, with setter
methods that ensure the attributes are assigned valid values.

---

## Code Along

This lesson is a code-along, so fork and clone the repo.

**NOTE: Remember to run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and
`pipenv shell` to enter your virtual environment before running your code.**

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

## Evolve `Department` attributes to properties

We'll start by evolving the `Department` class to add property methods to manage
the `name` and `location` attributes, as shown in the code below. The setter
methods will check for non-empty string values prior to updating the object
state:

```py
from __init__ import CURSOR, CONN

class Department:

    # Dictionary of objects saved to the database.
    all = {}

    def __init__(self, name, location, id=None):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.location = location

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Department {self.id}: {self.name}, {self.location}>"

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, name):
        if isinstance(name, str) and len(name):
            self._name = name
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Name must be a non-empty string"
            )

    @property
    def location(self):
        return self._location

    @location.setter
    def location(self, location):
        if isinstance(location, str) and len(location):
            self._location = location
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Location must be a non-empty string"
            )

    # Existing ORM methods ....

```

We'll also update the `Employee` class to add property methods to manage the
`name`, `job_title` and `department_id` attributes. Note the `department_id`
setter method checks to ensure we are assigning a valid department by checking
the foreign key reference in the database:

```py
from __init__ import CURSOR, CONN
from department import Department


class Employee:

    # Dictionary of objects saved to the database.
    all = {}

    def __init__(self, name, job_title, department_id, id=None):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.job_title = job_title
        self.department_id = department_id

    def __repr__(self):
        return (
            f"<Employee {self.id}: {self.name}, {self.job_title}, "
            + f"Department: {self.department.name} >"
        )

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, name):
        if isinstance(name, str) and len(name):
            self._name = name
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Name must be a non-empty string"
            )

    @property
    def job_title(self):
        return self._job_title

    @job_title.setter
    def job_title(self, job_title):
        if isinstance(job_title, str) and len(job_title):
            self._job_title = job_title
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "job_title must be a non-empty string"
            )

    @property
    def department_id(self):
        return self._department_id

    @department_id.setter
    def department_id(self, department_id):
        if type(department_id) is int and Department.find_by_id(department_id):
            self._department_id = department_id
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "department_id must reference a department in the database")

     # Existing ORM methods ....

```

The `lib/testing` folder has two new test files for testing the properties,
`department_property_test.py` and `employee_property_test.py`. Run the tests to
ensure the property validations work correctly:

```bash
pytest -x
```

You can also use an `ipdb` session to test the properties.

```bash
python lib/debug.py
```

Type each statement one at a time into the `ipbd>` prompt:

```py
ipdb> Department.get_all()
[<Department 1: Payroll, Building A, 5th Floor>, <Department 2: Human Resources, Building C, East Wing>]
ipdb> payroll = Department.find_by_name("Payroll")
ipdb> payroll
<Department 1: Payroll, Building A, 5th Floor>
ipdb> payroll.location = 7
*** ValueError: Location must be a non-empty string
ipdb>
```

Let's try to set an invalid department id for an employee:

```bash
ipdb> employee = Employee.find_by_id(1)
ipdb> employee
<Employee 1: Amir, Accountant, Department ID: 1>
ipdb> employee.department_id = 1000
*** ValueError: department_id must reference a department in the database
```

## Conclusion

Properties manage the access and mutation of attributes. We can use property
setter methods to ensure we assign valid values prior to persisting objects to
the database.
